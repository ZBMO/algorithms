__Bubble Sort__
---
time complexity:  
- worst: O(n^2)  
- best: O(n)

Adaptive when using flag to check for swap on a pass.  
In-place

####Benefits:
Bubble sort time complexity for best case (already sorted list) is O(n).  
However, insertion sort shares this feature while performing better in the worst case.

K passes results in the k largest elements at the end of the list.

####Other:
Improvements on bubble sort include 'Cocktail sort' and 'Comb sort'.
