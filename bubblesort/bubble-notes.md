__Bubble Sort__
---
time complexity:  O(n^2) - exponential time growth  

---
####Benefits:
Bubble sort time complexity for best case (already sorted list) is O(n).  
However, insertion sort shares this feature while performing better in the worst case.

---
####Other:
Improvements on bubble sort include 'Cocktail sort' and 'Comb sort'.
