Static vs dynamic memory allocation
context: 1 segment (64 x 1024b) / 64kb

memory gets divided between heap, stack & code.
memory allocated at compile time is stack frame, this is static memory.
e.g. main() {int a; float b} takes 6 bytes in stack frame

activation records in stack memory are removed / de-allocated after the function
completes

unlike stack, heap memory is unorganized
program cannot directly access heap memory, uses pointers
